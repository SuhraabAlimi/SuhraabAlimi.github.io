      In the past 70 years, AI has been growing exponentially to the point that people have started to think that AI (Artificially Intelligent being [computer]) has become sentient. Though this may not be true, we could look forward to this in the future, though it is not nearly as close as one thinks it is. When this finally is brought, one would think that an accomplishment this big would boost the world into a utopia, though this isn’t the case.

      The utopian society that most people expect from sentient AIs would be one where hard jobs are done by the "robots” while the humans are able to reap the harvests of living a job free and carefree life, though this is not the case. A sentient being is defined as one with the ability to feel emotions and think for themselves, and although this may lead to some jobs not being needed to be done by humans, there are many other, more important jobs that are not able to be done with just a thinking robot. These, more physical jobs, include farming and house building, as for these jobs to become automated, the working robots or farmer robots would need to be able to do everything a human construction worker or farmer could do. Even when robots do jobs that were used to be done by humans, there are more jobs being created then taken over (Orduña 11). Before this utopian society can be reached, robots need to not only be sentient, but also be able to do almost anything a regular human would be able to do.

      No AI doing one's job will ever be perfect. In the past year alone, there have been over 250 crashes of auto piloting Tesla vehicles being driven by their built in AI, and although this number could go down in the coming years, it will never fully reach a net 0 (Siddiqui 1). There are sometimes choices an AI would need to make that would always have a negative outcome, with the world disagreeing on if it was the correct choice. In the philosophical narrative game, “Trolley Problem, Inc.” the player is tasked with making these types of choices frequently, with one of the main topics being about car AI’s making sentient choices. On a specific question, it states if the AI should value the lives of the driver and passengers or the victims of an unavoidable car crash. This question then is varied, asking if the car would swerve for a more important person, such as one who would cure cancer, or for ones that caused the accident, such as jaywalking children. If the more important person should be saved, how would a sentient car AI know who is more important? If every life should be valued the same, why would a passenger want to buy a car that would rather kill them instead of 2 convicts? These thought provoking questions brought together in “Trolley Problem, Inc.” show that any AI, no matter if sentient or not, will ever cause the world to become a utopia by itself.

Even hypothetically when robots are able to flawlessly do our jobs for us, instead of the world becoming a utopian society, due to humans’ trait of greed, it would only worsen the world, through laying off millions of jobs and bringing their families into poverty. In order to stop this from happening, the corporations must be run by AI’s that specifically don’t have the trait of greed, though that wouldn’t be a true sentient AI. A selfless, semi-sentient AI running large corporations would be better than a fully sentient one, though this would in reality never occur due to corporations already being owned by greed-filled individuals.

        <p class="paragraphSomething">
      Although AI’s growth is getting close to mimicking sentient beings, there is still a long way to go before it reaches its true sentience, though even after this, the world still won’t become a utopia.
