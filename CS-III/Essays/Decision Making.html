      Bias is known as the distortion of information or decisions, causing one outcome to become more likely than another, which can occur on purpose or accidentally. When making the decisions with my ISP group, many different biases occur, most of them being accidental. Some of these biases include habit, overconfidence, regression, complexity, and optimism bias.
      
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphSomething">
      The most important decision for my ISP group was what to make our project in. There are many different game engines to choose from, like Unreal Engine, GDevelop, and Panda3D, but my team ultimately chose Unity due to Habit Bias. Habit Bias is a bias where the perpetrator does or chooses something “only because it was used before" (Gettys, Kelly & Peterson, 1973). In the past, both me and some of the other group members have used the Unity engine, and we have grown to like it, so when brought up with a choice to choose what engine to use, we all voted on Unity, as it was our habit. In order for us to prevent or drastically reduce this bias, we would all try out the diverse and different game engines and then choose again after knowing and becoming familiar with the other engines.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphSomething">
    Another bias I myself show more than my group is overconfidence bias. Normally, game creation takes 4-5 years for a project of size that we strive to, though my group is limited to about 6 months, so normally, we would shrink our ambitions, though we didn’t. Overconfidence bias is self explanatory, as it “is the tendency people have to be more confident in their own abilities,” when they really aren’t (McCombs 1). This applies to me as my ambitions of making a game and my prior understanding of Unity make me believe that with enough work, my team will be able to complete this ambitious project, even if realistically we wouldn’t finish. Overcoming this bias would first have to confront and accept the bias, and then shrink the size and ambitions that I hold for the project, and think more realistically, and be more humble in me and my groups’ abilities. </p>
    <p class="paragraphSomething">
      Regression bias is the tendency to regress or go easier on judgements after long and subsequent work days. I predict that this bias will be clearly visible in many groups’ ISPs, including mine, as through experience, most people are seen to put off hard and tedious work until the end of the project, and when working on these tasks, people, like my group, could get frustrated and we would pass things that would normally fail quality checks, making our final project lower quality. In order to stop Regression bias, our group will follow the Gantt chart that we had created, and we will also make sure tedious work is split up across members and across the dates, so the later half of the project is not only tedious and boring.
    </p>

 <p class="paragraphSomething">
   A bias that is somewhat related to regression is Complexity bias. This bias is when simpler tasks such as creating tracking scripts are believed to be much harder than they actually are, due to factors such as time pressure. As stated before, our group is trying to complete a product that usually takes up to 10x the development time, meaning that time crunches will most likely exist, so complexity bias, where a member is overloaded with small tasks and is unable to complete them due to their perceivement of the tasks being more complex, will occur in our group. In order to subdue this bias, our group will split tasks and follow a schedule, outlined by the Gantt chart, so time crunches are minimized and all members of the group are able to complete the work on time. </p>
 <p class="paragraphSomething">
   Finally, the most prominent bias in our group would be the optimism bias. This bias is the over estimation of when a task will be completed or when an event will happen, which in our case would be a task. This type of bias can already be seen in our project, as although our Gantt chart states that we should be a good portion into the project, we have just barely started, meaning that we had overestimated how long our group would take to warm up and learn how to work as a team, leaving us behind. In order to fix this, our group must all work together harder in order to make it back to the Gantt chart’s schedule, and then work with the Gantt chart to completely stop this bias from occurring.
 </p>
    <p class="paragraphSomething">
      Bias is a crucial thing that we as a group must overcome, as it can cause our ISP to degrade in quality through many diverse ways.
