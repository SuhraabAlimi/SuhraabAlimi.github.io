      Anytime you go into a website, there's always a prefix at the beginning of the site, being HTTP or HTTPS, but what's the difference? Hypertext transfer protocol differs from hypertext transfer protocol secure the same way the two’s names differ: HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, as "the 'S' added to the end of the 'HTTP' means SECURE" (Gibson, 2013). HTTPS is used when secure information is in question, such as buying items with your credit card or logging into an account, though more and more sites use it for its advantages in security.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphSomething">
      The purposes of HTTPS are to be able to send and receive data from the website securely and safely, without the threat of hackers stealing your information. One of these dangerous attacks is the Man-In-The-Middle-Attack, also known as the Monkey-In-The-Middle-Attack, or MITM(A) for short. This is a scary attack where hackers position themselves between you and the website in this case and try to "intercept and/or alter data traveling" between you and the website (NIST, 2015). This can cause you to get your private information, like your credit card number, stolen and used without your consent or your approval. Though these attacks may discourage one's use of the internet with sensitive information, sites with a prefix of HTTPS encrypt the information being transmitted, so no hacker can steal your information, and you can safely browse the web. This encrypted information occurs through hashes, which encrypt and decrypt into "32 character-long hashes" when sending (Taub, 2020). For a hash to be good quality, it should be at least 32 characters. There are still flaws with HTTPS, though, as a specific type of MITM(A) could potentially bypass the encryption. This attack is classified as an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) interception, where the attacker intercepts the information, but is also able to scan and decrypt it.
      </p>
    <p class="paragraphSomething">
      Between 4% and 7% of all HTTPS traffic are intercepted, though some are not malicious. There are many ways to prevent these SSL interceptions, with most being about safe internet usage. The most important ones are to use a trusted computer, only accepting trusted certificates, and thinking before you visit a website. If you suspect that an SSL interception might have happened, there are ways to detect it. To do this you need to compare the certificate authority of your connection and the one of the website to see if they match, and if they don’t then that is a sign of an SSL interception. This is not always 100% accurate, though, as a false negative, when you believe there was no interception but there was, or a false positive, where you believe there was an interception but there wasn’t, can occur, with the latter being less severe than the first. A certificate authority is a website’s proof of authenticity through physical verification such as phone numbers. Its role is to verify a website’s integrity. Another helper to guarantee safe and secure websites is an HTTPS Proxy Alliance, which private institutions usually use, such as schools.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphSomething">
      Our schools and governments are able to eavesdrop on communications only in specific circumstances. For schools, when students are in class and using school technology, what is done on them should be able to be monitored by the school, though not on personal devices not using the school’s WIFI. The government should be able to eavesdrop on sites as long as it only does it on specific sites where it is clearly stated that it is monitored.
