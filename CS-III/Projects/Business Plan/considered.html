    <p>
      I was strongly intrigued by Dude Chen’s proposal as the problem being addressed is aimed towards me, as I too am a teen who wants a fast and easy to learn transportation device to use to go to places such as my friend Evan’s house, or Mcdonalds. I am also interested in how the auto balancing feature would work, as I am currently in AP Physics 2 and would like to help brainstorm ideas and ways to keep the forces and the vehicle balanced. Although I commend this idea and really like it, I ultimately am unable to choose it as I believe I am extremely under-qualified for this job, as it most likely would need knowledge of Robotics, which I lack.

      <h1> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zoe-yau/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Available Tables</a></h1>  
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      This ISP idea was one with consideration as it looks very useful and could potentially change the way all restaurants operate. The idea of being able to reserve any open table of any restaurant with the click of a button seemed absurd to me, though after a quick rethought, I remembered that movie theaters already work this way, so doing this for tables would be ingenious. Another reason for its consideration is my personal experience with table reservations, as once during a friend’s birthday party, we were supposed to reserve a table at a high end restaurant, though we were unable to due to the restaurant lacking the superior technology for it, so our seats at the restaurant were jeopardized. This had high consideration, though I did not choose it in the end as I feel that to make it work, the project would need to partner an actual restaurant, which I believe might be possible with the time frame given.

  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
I considered this ISP due to my interest in getting a part time job myself, and I thought the research for this project would help me on my journey through the job application process. I am also the target audience, so I could help with testing in order to see the expected reaction from them. Ultimately I did not choose this ISP as although I am interested in job applications), I am not very interested in having to create something to automatically find jobs and list them to be applied to.    </p>

    <h1> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/qasem-abdeljaber/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Self-Unblocking VPN </a></h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      Ever since I’ve had a phone, schools have always blocked most applications and websites I use on a daily basis, causing me to resort to using a VPN. This bypass is used by Neeraj and others including myself in order to research for classes on websites that have automatically been blocked for known reasons, as they are fully informational and are excellent aid in projects for hard classes such as AP classes, where you are expected to be able to know endless knowledge. Recently, the school has been blocking VPNs, meaning that these websites are unable to be used anymore, hindering the learning and work of hundreds of studious students. Additionally, many children such as myself use the VPNs during off periods to play games when all work is completed, which relieves lots of stress from classes where lots of thinking is put in, such as AP Calculus BC. I don’t think I would be able to make it through the day if I could not play my favorite mobile games such as Clash Royal in order to relieve stress during my passing and off periods, though I have been blessed with an unlimited data plan provided by Verizon. I’ve considered this ISP to the point where it could have been my actual choice, as my points before made me very against the school’s decision to block VPNs, though I did not choose this as I do not know how to approach this problem, as I feel as if any VPN we create would easily be fully blocked by the school administration.

    <h1> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/caysen-mayo/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Momentum-Based Fighting Game </a></h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
I considered this ISP as I am experienced in the game engine that the group will be using, being Unity. I also was very intrigued by the games that were listed as similar, as I am exceptionally intelligent in how Mediatonic’s battle royale platformer, Fall Gays works, and I have lots of experience playing and learning about Flappy Bird. Although I would love to work on games like this, many games promise to be similar to games one likes, and turn out much different than the said games, and I am afraid I would tarnish the reputation of the golden aged games such as Flappy Bird, so I will leave the work to the most inspired.    </p>

    <h1> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/neeraj-gogate/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Code Translator </a></h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
I considered this project as I have some experience with code translators in the past, although they do not convert from and to some languages that this one will do, with the most prominent being Swift. Although I considered it, I believe that it would be too hard to make, as many coding languages have countless built in functions that couldn’t be easily translated, and I do not believe I am built for this much complex work to create an AI that can turn one function into another.    </p>

      <div class="bofy">
    <p>
This project was almost chosen as I like creating games, and branching out into Roblox Studio would make my knowledge more flexible, and I am interested in the type of game this is, though if I use my time to make a game, I would first want to make a tower defense game rather than ones that I am only semi interested in. For this reason, I was unable to choose this for my ISP, though in the future if given the opportunity, I would reconsider my thoughts.    </p>

  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
This project got me interested as I have started getting into cooking and making my own healthy meals in order to sustain and improve my physique.  With an app like this, I would be able to find recipes easily without having to read articles, and by working on this app, I could share my recipes with others. Although this is very interesting, I am not choosing it as I am not interested in creating a mobile app, though I do have much experience with these apps and applying adverts for them.

    <h1> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Eagle Card </a></h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      This project has a very interesting concept in my opinion. Business cards for students could improve the school in many ways, such as allowing for common ambitions to be shared easier with other students. Having it customizable would bring out the creativity of many, and would be very fun to talk about and show off. Although I like the concept, I do not see myself working on this project as I have no experience with encryption and other areas that this project requires.

    <h1> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/suhraab-alimi/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Stefano Tower Defense HD </a></h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
This project started by me is the one that I feel I can most comfortably and enjoyably do in the restricted time frame, as I already have a specific idea of what everything would look like and what would be needed. I really like tower defense games such as the Bloons Tower Defense series and have countless hours in many of the games in the series. I also like story based games as well, and I believe that I have what it takes to bring the two genres together and succeed. I fully chose this project because of how enjoyable it would be to create, as I am an intermediate level in modeling and a somewhat expert in navigating and coding in the Unity Engine, which is what this would use.    </p>
