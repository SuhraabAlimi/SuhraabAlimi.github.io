    <p>
      Tower Defense Game with multiple levels and towers with upgrades where the goal is to stop Stefano from finishing the track. There will be at least 5 different towers to choose from, each with 8 unique upgrades in order to make every game unique. Each level will have different Stefano attempting to pass you, so you must create your defenses accordingly and not let too many past, or you lose. When you complete all the levels, you will be greeted with a final, very hard level, which after completion, will unlock the final games to complete the hidden story expressed in the levels.

    <h1>Problem</h1>
  
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      Children and teenagers want to play a fun game to pass the time that requires both knowledge and skill but has a simple concept. Without a fun game, these people of adolesence's happiness and joy would be significantly lower than with one. These ages of children are the learning ages, so they need to be able to learn problem solving skills, and gain the skill of fast reactions, which without these skills, could hinder ones ability to work or drive.

<h1>Our Solution</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      Stefano Tower Defense HD is a game designed for adolescenct people that is simple to start but hard to master. There will be many complex enemies that you must defeat, through quickly placing towers and upgrading them. Some towers excel at specific circumstances, while others are better at other ones, so knowing what tower to place at what time is key. Sometimes, the player will need to quickly remove towers and add others in order to survive, so quick wits and skill is almost certainly needed. Some levels' rounds will need to be planned out ahead of time, so while playing the game, players would gain skills in planning, as well as fast reactions and problem solving from the circumstances before.

<h1>Target Market</h1>
  <div class="bofy">

  <div class="hader21">
<h1>The Competition</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      There are thousands of different tower defense games that could be classified as competition, but the most prominent one would be Bloons TD 6 by Ninja Kiwi. Bloons is a tower defense game with over 20+ unique towers each with over 60 different types. Although this game may seem to be better than anything we could make, we will be taking a different approach in the tower defense genre by branching out and having a story mode as the main mode, which Bloons clearly lacks. This new mode will allow Stefano Tower Defense HD to be able to compete equally with Bloons, though it will just take up a different approach in the same genre.
