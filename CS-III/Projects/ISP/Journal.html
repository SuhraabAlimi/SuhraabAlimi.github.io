      We were challenged this week with having to create a placeholder shop, which was most of our team's first interactions with GUI. I was assigned to make a script to choose a specified tower to place, while the others in my group were to connect the old placement script from a few weeks ago with the selecting script and connecting the button to the selection functionality. There were some puzzling areas, as the chosen tower type kept get unselected in my situation, though I was able to complete my task in a somewhat normal amount of time.

      As my other teammates tasks branched off of my work being done, I had to complete my part earlier in the week, to maximise the amount of time my teammates could work, Though I wasn't able to get it done in one day like expected, due to unexpected errors such as the one above.

      Dividing the three tasks took comically longer than expected, as we each did not know what the others wanted to work on, and we all waited for the other members to first choose a job, though as everyone was waiting, nobody chose one for a good while, effectively wasting time, though in the end we divided the work through a spinner.

      This week, we were tasked with creating the second tower. The materials of this tower were complex compared to the other towers, and it took a while for the three of us to find the perfect shades for every part of this tower. The tower also needed an idle animation, though none of us in the group have mastered animation in Unity, so we had to learn it on a whim, and I feel that we succeeded in creating an animation fit for now. We still need to complete importing the other towers' models and tweaking them in Unity.

      We are still behind on the previously created Gantt chart, and our work has deviated off of the original schedule, so we will variate the original chart to match with what we are working with at the moment. Due to our beginning pace being not as optimal as needed, we may need to cut off some minor features that could be though of as not needed.

      This week, we did not know how to split the tasks at hand among us, which caused us to lose precious work time. After we made an agreement, I was tasked with importing and tweaking the new tower's model as I had it already downloaded, while my other two members had to create the idle animation and allow the tower to attack respectively. Once we all knew our tasks at hand, our productivity skyrocketed.

      This week's technical challenges sprouted from a few lines of code that we, as a team, had composed. The code mentioned was supposed to show any tower of your choosing to follow your mouse, as long as you hover over a placeable area, though as you may expect, this was not the case. For some absurd reason, when we had attempted to place a tower, the tower type that we had previously chosed continued to become deselected, even after selecting it multiple times. When looking into the code, we found the problem almost immediately. In the Update() function, there was a line of code that always set the ghost object of the tower we were selecting to false, therefore rendering all the lines attempting to move the non-existent object useless. After finding the source of our conflict, all we needed to do was remove the line, and everything worked picture perfectly.

     This week was hopefully the last where meeting conficts occur, as we agreed on having one weekly meeting every friday at around 9:00 PM, where we would discuss what we had completed and our next steps. Unlike what seemed like every previous week working on the project, this week, we all were able to attend the first meeting that we agreed upon.

      This week, we had a disagreement on how placing towers should work, and although we came upon an agreement, our solution seems rugged, and may be changed later. Some of the group proposed that the tower should only be visible over places that itself can be placed, while others claimed that it isn't smooth, so the tower should be visible anywhere, but yet another counterarguement was soon to be spawned. They believe that due to all the scenery around the maps, having the ability to hover a tower anywhere would make things clip into eachother, and after a few minutes of back and forths, the subsequent group conceded, and we went with the first idea.

      The technical challenges we had this week were caused by our lack of conclusive knowledge on setting up PlasticSCM to work correctly with our Unity project. At first, my PlasticSCM was severely out of date, so it couldn't pull any commits of any recently made projects, so I had to do a complete reinstallation of the software, and only then could I actually commit the project onto the cloud. We then had to invite the group members to be able to collaborate on the project, which also had took a couple of hours of troubleshooting.

      In order to set up PlasticSCM, we would all need to be on a call at once to discuss and troubleshoot the invites and the software, though many scheduled meetings had to get cancelled until we finally were able to set up the software on Friday. The planned meetings got cancelled for various reasons, such as unexpected schoolwork, housework, and shifts at work, as well as more personal reasons. Hopefully next week, we will finally create a good meeting schedule that works for everyone, though this will be somewhat of a challenge.

      This week did not have many interpersonal challenges that weren't already listed in the Scheduling Challenges tab, though there were still some. Just like last week, there were disagreements over the story of the project, though shortly after this conflict, we remembered that our progress at the moment is minimal, so the story shouldn't be fully decided yet, so we had left it at there. We also disagreed on the difficulty of the game as a whole, as some of us wanted it to be easy to beat, though others argued it defeated the purpose of needing to use unique towers, and that the game should be hard, though in the end, we met in the middle and decided to have difficulty gradually scale as the player learns and experiments with new strategies.

      Our main technical challenges this week branched from the conflict of using both PlasticSCM and Github with our Unity Project. The main issue stems from the fact that both of these tools are ways that the team can share commits with eachother, though PlasticSCM is not seeable from the outside, while github is. Although it may seem that PlasticSCM is outclassed by Github due to this setback, we are continuing to use both as PlasticSCM makes sharing and pulling files much easier through personal means, though we will still upload all work to Github. Additionally, me and my teammates are used to commiting small tasks many times, though doing this for Github will not be efficient, as each commit will override many important and big files, that could take a while to push, so Github will be pushed to at the end of a work day, whilst PlasticSCM will be generously updated throughout the workday.

      As it seems, every other member in my group is in a different Computer Science period as me, so our inability to meet and discuss our project hinders our efficiency, so we must schedule meetings frequently, though through trials of this, we have shown to all have complex schedules, with some of our group members having to work many days as well as juggling homework given by AP classes, so even to say that we are all able to meet twice a week would be generous. To surpass this challenge, we must schedule meeting far beforehand, to make sure everyone is free.

      The only interpersonal challenges that the three of us have been met with were disagreements on how the game should be structured. For example, one of my teammates had mentioned a tower type that sounded interesting, but through my knowledge of Unity's libraries and C# as a whole, I disagreed with the inclusion of the idea as to implement it, it would take more effort than the outcome needed. They were understanding, and knew that the amount of work that we already had on our plates was grand enough. We also were struck with a small problem of not having an easy way for the three of us to communicate easily, though this problem was completed astonishingly quickly, as we had exchanged numbers, then later down the line, we created a group chat on discord for the three of us to express our ideas to each other seamlessly.

    <h1>(Software) Development Engineer</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      Development Engineers are the ones that actually program, build, and design the software. This job can range from composing code to be used in the product to writing APIs and working with other members. I beleive that I am more than suitable to take this job, as on other group projects before this, I had taken up this role, though I mostly had worked on back-end. This may not be a problem, however, as I have somewhat more experience with the coding language then my other groupmates.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hader21">
    <h1>QA Engineer</h1>
  
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The QA Engineer is responsible to make sure the product that we create does not have problems that would halt the usage of itself, such as bugs that if not fixed, would brick the software. They also have to make sure the software runs smoothly, which for our project, is an important trait. Although I may qualify to fit this role, I do not believe that I fit this role due to my workstyle, as I usually like to create new parts and only go work back on previous when absolutely needing to. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="hader21">
<h1>Project Manager</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
The project manager manages the project as a whole, setting day limits on how long parts of the project should take, creating ideas and functions, and giving out tasks to be completed. I feel that this role would be somewhat able to fit this role, as although my planning skills can be argued as subliminal, I am able to complete the other tasks that this role has to handle, such as setting tasks and managing the progression of the project.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="hader21">
<h1>Product Manager</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The product manager is responsible for fine tuning and establishing the final product, which can be seen through collaborating with the engineers to shape the project to become the end product that they sought out for, and improve the project enough to become a full-fledged product. I feel that this job would be the one to fit me the most, as I had been the one to come up with the idea of this ISP project, and I already have an end goal in mind, so I strongly beleive that I would be able to lead the product into becoming what the original idea was supposed to be.
    </p>
    </div>

  <div class="hader21">
<h1>Release Engineer</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The release engineers focuses on creating specific versions of the project that are made during development to test how the product works at the time of the creation of the build, which are usually used for testing. These builds will be tested by the QA engineers, and they will give their responses to the development engineers. They must also find any problems that the product has, if any, and report and attempt to fix them. They manage the releases through GitHub and create and edit branches. This job is the least suitable for me, as I do not have much intermediate/expert experience with creating and maintaining branches in Github, and I would rather create new functions and parts rather than dwell on the older parts and improve them.
