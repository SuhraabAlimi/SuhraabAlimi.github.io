    <h1>(Software) Development Engineer</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      Development Engineers are the ones that actually program, build, and design the software. This job can range from composing code to be used in the product to writing APIs and working with other members. I beleive that I am more than suitable to take this job, as on other group projects before this, I had taken up this role, though I mostly had worked on back-end. This may not be a problem, however, as I have somewhat more experience with the coding language then my other groupmates.

    <h1>QA Engineer</h1>
  
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The QA Engineer is responsible to make sure the product that we create does not have problems that would halt the usage of itself, such as bugs that if not fixed, would brick the software. They also have to make sure the software runs smoothly, which for our project, is an important trait. Although I may qualify to fit this role, I do not believe that I fit this role due to my workstyle, as I usually like to create new parts and only go work back on previous when absolutely needing to.

<h1>Project Manager</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
The project manager manages the project as a whole, setting day limits on how long parts of the project should take, creating ideas and functions, and giving out tasks to be completed. I feel that this role would be somewhat able to fit this role, as although my planning skills can be argued as subliminal, I am able to complete the other tasks that this role has to handle, such as setting tasks and managing the progression of the project.

<h1>Product Manager</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The product manager is responsible for fine tuning and establishing the final product, which can be seen through collaborating with the engineers to shape the project to become the end product that they sought out for, and improve the project enough to become a full-fledged product. I feel that this job would be the one to fit me the most, as I had been the one to come up with the idea of this ISP project, and I already have an end goal in mind, so I strongly beleive that I would be able to lead the product into becoming what the original idea was supposed to be.

<h1>Release Engineer</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The release engineers focuses on creating specific versions of the project that are made during development to test how the product works at the time of the creation of the build, which are usually used for testing. These builds will be tested by the QA engineers, and they will give their responses to the development engineers. They must also find any problems that the product has, if any, and report and attempt to fix them. They manage the releases through GitHub and create and edit branches. This job is the least suitable for me, as I do not have much intermediate/expert experience with creating and maintaining branches in Github, and I would rather create new functions and parts rather than dwell on the older parts and improve them.
