    <h1>Technical Challenges</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      Our main technical challenges this week branched from the conflict of using both PlasticSCM and Github with our Unity Project. The main issue stems from the fact that both of these tools are ways that the team can share commits with eachother, though PlasticSCM is not seeable from the outside, while github is. Although it may seem that PlasticSCM is outclassed by Github due to this setback, we are continuing to use both as PlasticSCM makes sharing and pulling files much easier through personal means, though we will still upload all work to Github. Additionally, me and my teammates are used to commiting small tasks many times, though doing this for Github will not be efficient, as each commit will override many important and big files, that could take a while to push, so Github will be pushed to at the end of a work day, whilst PlasticSCM will be generously updated throughout the workday.

    <h1>Scheduling Challenges</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      As it seems, every other member in my group is in a different Computer Science period as me, so our inability to meet and discuss our project hinders our efficiency, so we must schedule meetings frequently, though through trials of this, we have shown to all have complex schedules, with some of our group members having to work many days as well as juggling homework given by AP classes, so even to say that we are all able to meet twice a week would be generous. To surpass this challenge, we must schedule meeting far beforehand, to make sure everyone is free.

    <h1>Interpersonal Challenges</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The only interpersonal challenges that the three of us have been met with were disagreements on how the game should be structured. For example, one of my teammates had mentioned a tower type that sounded interesting, but through my knowledge of Unity's libraries and C# as a whole, I disagreed with the inclusion of the idea as to implement it, it would take more effort than the outcome needed. They were understanding, and knew that the amount of work that we already had on our plates was grand enough. We also were struck with a small problem of not having an easy way for the three of us to communicate easily, though this problem was completed astonishingly quickly, as we had exchanged numbers, then later down the line, we created a group chat on discord for the three of us to express our ideas to each other seamlessly.

    <h1>(Software) Development Engineer</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      Development Engineers are the ones that actually program, build, and design the software. This job can range from composing code to be used in the product to writing APIs and working with other members. I beleive that I am more than suitable to take this job, as on other group projects before this, I had taken up this role, though I mostly had worked on back-end. This may not be a problem, however, as I have somewhat more experience with the coding language then my other groupmates.
    </p>

    <div class="hader21">
    <h1>QA Engineer</h1>
  
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The QA Engineer is responsible to make sure the product that we create does not have problems that would halt the usage of itself, such as bugs that if not fixed, would brick the software. They also have to make sure the software runs smoothly, which for our project, is an important trait. Although I may qualify to fit this role, I do not believe that I fit this role due to my workstyle, as I usually like to create new parts and only go work back on previous when absolutely needing to. 
    </p>

  <div class="hader21">
<h1>Project Manager</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
The project manager manages the project as a whole, setting day limits on how long parts of the project should take, creating ideas and functions, and giving out tasks to be completed. I feel that this role would be somewhat able to fit this role, as although my planning skills can be argued as subliminal, I am able to complete the other tasks that this role has to handle, such as setting tasks and managing the progression of the project.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="hader21">
<h1>Product Manager</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The product manager is responsible for fine tuning and establishing the final product, which can be seen through collaborating with the engineers to shape the project to become the end product that they sought out for, and improve the project enough to become a full-fledged product. I feel that this job would be the one to fit me the most, as I had been the one to come up with the idea of this ISP project, and I already have an end goal in mind, so I strongly beleive that I would be able to lead the product into becoming what the original idea was supposed to be.
    </p>
    </div>

  <div class="hader21">
<h1>Release Engineer</h1>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>
      The release engineers focuses on creating specific versions of the project that are made during development to test how the product works at the time of the creation of the build, which are usually used for testing. These builds will be tested by the QA engineers, and they will give their responses to the development engineers. They must also find any problems that the product has, if any, and report and attempt to fix them. They manage the releases through GitHub and create and edit branches. This job is the least suitable for me, as I do not have much intermediate/expert experience with creating and maintaining branches in Github, and I would rather create new functions and parts rather than dwell on the older parts and improve them.
