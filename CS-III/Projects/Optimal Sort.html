      The graph shows that bubble sort takes the longest to sort the words, as at 100,000 words, the sort takes around 301,000 ms for the average of reverse, ordered, and random. Insertion sort with the reversed text is the next longest function, followed by Selection Sort Ordered, Reverse, and Random, which were all very close to each other, at about 175,000 ms for 100,000 words. Insertion Sort reversed is in this position because it would have to switch for every new word added. Insertion sort random is the next slowest, at about 117,000 ms. The fastest was insertion sortâ€™s order, as it does not have to swap any values. All of the sorts have times of near values for sorting 100, 10, and 1 words, nearing at 12,000, 20, and 5 ms respectively, while 10,000 words has a moderate range, with the slowest being bubble sort reverse at around 14,000 ms, and the fastest being insertion sort ordered at about 380 ms, which was also the fastest for 100,000 words, though the time difference between the two is great.
