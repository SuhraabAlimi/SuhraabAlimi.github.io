    <h1>Why My Digital Portfolio is Important to Me</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="bofy">
    <p>My digital portfolio is important and useful because of all the unique opportunities where I can use it to show off my accomplishments and projects, such as my ISP from last year. My digital portfolio allows me to show my improvement over time, so I am able to reflect on my improvements over the past. I am able to keep track of my projects, and can store them for others to download and use. I am also able to download them myself in order to use them anywhere I go. I can also use this to have more information about specific projects and interests stated then a resume, so I am able to show more of my skills than with just a resume. The digital portfolio is also more useful than having all projects physically, as those can be lost, while the digital portfolio can have many backups on different websites and hosting sites such as Github.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important factor that my Digital portfolio aids me with is its usefulness for applications for jobs and colleges. As employers can see my work and accomplishments, they are able to know exactly what Iâ€™m like, and are able to evaluate if I am a matching candidate for the job they are supplying. An employer can also look for specific skills easily on the Digital Portfolio, as navigating through it is faster than reading a resume.
