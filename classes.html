    <p1> In Computer Science 2 taught by Mrs. Jang, I had improved my coding skills from being a beginner to an advanced coder. I had learned many different things, such as the Model View Controller and how to use an API in a website to hold data. I also got my first taste in creating websites as well as working in a large group with designated jobs.

    <p1> In Computer Science 1 taught by Mrs. Jang, I had learned the basics of being a coder and coding. I learned many things, such as for loops, if statements, functions, and coding in swift, which I later branched off from to code in C#. This was my first experience with coding, and I am glad I was able to be taught the coding basics effectively!
