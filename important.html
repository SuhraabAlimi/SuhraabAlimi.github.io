  <div class="bofy">
    <p1> My Digital Portfolio (DP) is important to me because it allows me to show off what I have done and what important classes I took, as well as allowing employers to know about me to see if I am a matching candidate for job openings. I am able to list all my accomplishments in one place, making it easier to research and learn about me.
